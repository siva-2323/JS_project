# Calculator Project

## Project Description

  It is a calculator project. It functions like a normal calculator.C means clear. When a user clicks it, it should clear everything and go back to the first state it was in when the page loaded. The back arrow is like pressing backspace; it'll delete the last character typed. If it's clicked when there's only one digit, it sets the current number to be 0. Calculators tend to have some special behavior when you hit equals: if you type another number it erases the results and starts over. Feel free to do that but also free free (like me) to just treat it normally and make the user hit C if they want to clear it. Let's keep it simple.
